<h1>
  Gotta catch em all? (20 in 14)
</h1>

<p>A pipe dream of mine is to get a taste of each major language family in the world!</p>

<p>Rules to mark one language as ‚Äúdone‚Äù are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>complete the corresponding Duolingo tree of the language ‚Äì yes, I know this isn‚Äôt perfect, but it is the most tangible form of language learning right now!</li>
  <li>if a Duolingo tree is not available (Tagalog, Tamil, Thai, Lithuanian), finish one introductory book, finding one that is equivalent to roughly two semesters of university language courses</li>
  <li>spend at least 6 months learning it, no matter how much progress gets made in this time</li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôve selected 14 language families that are most spoken worldwide (see source for figures), but I will be breaking up the Indo-European family due to how broad it is</p>

<p>Below is the daunting list of languages written in (family: language [branch])</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Afroasiatic</strong>: Arabic [Semitic]</li>
  <li><strong>Austroasiatic</strong>: Vietnamese [Vietic]</li>
  <li><strong>Austronesian</strong>: Tagalog [Malayo-Polynesian] (Indonesian, my mother tongue, would count here!)</li>
  <li><strong>Auxiliary</strong>: Esperanto</li>
  <li><strong>Dravidian</strong>: Tamil [South]</li>
  <li><strong>Japonic</strong>: Japanese [Japonic]</li>
  <li><strong>Koreanic</strong>: Korean [isolate]</li>
  <li><strong>Kra-Dai</strong>: Thai [Tai]</li>
  <li><strong>Niger-Congo</strong>: Swahili [Bantu]</li>
  <li><strong>Sino-Tibetan</strong>: Mandarin Chinese [Sinitic]</li>
  <li><strong>Turkic</strong>: Turkish [Oghuz]</li>
  <li><strong>Uralic</strong>: Hungarian [Ugric]</li>
</ul>

<p>and for the <strong>Indo-European</strong> family:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Baltic</strong>: Lithuanian</li>
  <li><strong>Celtic</strong>: Irish</li>
  <li><strong>Germanic</strong>: German</li>
  <li><strong>Hellenic</strong>: Greek</li>
  <li><strong>Indo-Aryan</strong>: Hindi</li>
  <li><strong>Romance</strong>: Portuguese</li>
  <li><strong>Slavic</strong>: Russian</li>
</ul>

<p>plus a dialect of <strong>sign language</strong>. That would make it 20 languages over 14 families!</p>

<p>Spending roughly six months per language at minimum would then take me 120 months to complete this project of mine, or about 10 years. That‚Äôs pretty long for a project, but considering this is perhaps my biggest interest and one I‚Äôm willing to sink a lot of time into, I would not mind learning for life. This does not account for the time spent maintaining each language, if I end up maintaining it.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that this does not include duplicates of languages in the same branch! I am only listing one per family/branch, but it is for certain that I will be tempted to spend time on other languages. For example, I am currently (as of June 2021) spending some time brushing up on my French, which I learned for three years in middle school, and I have plans to learn Italian for Eurovision 2022 as well ;)</p>

<h3 id="progress-tracking">Progress tracking</h3>
<p>Languages actively learning:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Vietnamese</strong> (started June 2021) ‚Äì currently making it through the Duolingo tree!</li>
  <li><strong>French</strong> (started‚Ä¶ 2015) ‚Äì lots of time spent but didn‚Äôt create flashcards to review for it, so my knowledge has mostly disappeared except for my reading skills. currently picking it up again for a petite chanteuse that competed in Eurovision 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>Languages in maintenance:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>German</strong> (started 2018) ‚Äì spent the most time learning this, probably at a high B2 level right now, but I feel like I‚Äôve plateaued.</li>
  <li><strong>Portuguese</strong> (started May 2020) ‚Äì my quarantine project! not learning any much in terms of grammar, just sentence mining for now</li>
</ul>

<p>Languages spent time on</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Japanese</strong> ‚Äì got up to N4 level, 600 kanji learned, then abandoned it for other projects since it was taking up too much of my time</li>
  <li><strong>Esperanto</strong> ‚Äì kinda made progress on the Duolingo tree, abandoned it since</li>
</ul>
