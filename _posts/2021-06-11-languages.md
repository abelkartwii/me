title: Gotta catch em all? (20 in 14)
---

A pipe dream of mine is to get a taste of each major language family in the world!

Rules to mark one language as "done" are as follows:
- complete the corresponding Duolingo tree of the language -- yes, I know this isn't perfect, but it is the most tangible form of language learning right now!
- if a Duolingo tree is not available (Tagalog, Tamil, Thai, Lithuanian), finish one introductory book, finding one that is equivalent to roughly two semesters of university language courses
- spend at least 6 months learning it, no matter how much progress gets made in this time

I've selected 14 language families that are most spoken worldwide (see source for figures), but I will be breaking up the Indo-European family due to how broad it is

Below is the daunting list of languages written in (family: language [branch])
- **Afroasiatic**: Arabic [Semitic]
- **Austroasiatic**: Vietnamese [Vietic]
- **Austronesian**: Tagalog [Malayo-Polynesian] (Indonesian, my mother tongue, would count here!)
- **Auxiliary**: Esperanto
- **Dravidian**: Tamil [South]
- **Japonic**: Japanese [Japonic]
- **Koreanic**: Korean [isolate]
- **Kra-Dai**: Thai [Tai]
- **Niger-Congo**: Swahili [Bantu]
- **Sino-Tibetan**: Mandarin Chinese [Sinitic]
- **Turkic**: Turkish [Oghuz]
- **Uralic**: Hungarian [Ugric]

and for the **Indo-European** family:
- **Baltic**: Lithuanian
- **Celtic**: Irish
- **Germanic**: German
- **Hellenic**: Greek
- **Indo-Aryan**: Hindi
- **Romance**: Portuguese
- **Slavic**: Russian

plus a dialect of **sign language**. That would make it 20 languages over 14 families!

Spending roughly six months per language at minimum would then take me 120 months to complete this project of mine, or about 10 years. That's pretty long for a project, but considering this is perhaps my biggest interest and one I'm willing to sink a lot of time into, I would not mind learning for life. This does not account for the time spent maintaining each language, if I end up maintaining it.

Keep in mind that this does not include duplicates of languages in the same branch! I am only listing one per family/branch, but it is for certain that I will be tempted to spend time on other languages. For example, I am currently (as of June 2021) spending some time brushing up on my French, which I learned for three years in middle school, and I have plans to learn Italian for Eurovision 2022 as well ;)

### Progress tracking
Languages actively learning:
- **Vietnamese** (started June 2021) -- currently making it through the Duolingo tree!
- **French** (started... 2015) -- lots of time spent but didn't create flashcards to review for it, so my knowledge has mostly disappeared except for my reading skills. currently picking it up again for a petite chanteuse that competed in Eurovision 2021

Languages in maintenance:
- **German** (started 2018) -- spent the most time learning this, probably at a high B2 level right now, but I feel like I've plateaued. 
- **Portuguese** (started May 2020) -- my quarantine project! not learning any much in terms of grammar, just sentence mining for now

Languages spent time on
- **Japanese** -- got up to N4 level, 600 kanji learned, then abandoned it for other projects since it was taking up too much of my time
- **Esperanto** -- kinda made progress on the Duolingo tree, abandoned it since
