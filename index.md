### üçã who I am
I explore data and philosophy ‚Äî mostly separately, occassionally together.

There are so many things within (and outside of) those realms that I still haven't learned, and so my interests reflect a broad scope of topics. Right now they converge around **data engineering**, cloud computing, distributed systems, **climate change**, **tech ethics**, feminism, and possibly many others I have yet to explore. I've thought a lot about pipelines and how data can be reprocessed, how data can illustrate complex truths in our world, as well as the power of tech and how we can leverage it for the environment!

### üçé what I do
**Currently**, I am a junior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, pursuing a bachelor's degree in [computer science and philosophy](http://catalog.illinois.edu/undergraduate/eng_las/computer-science-philosophy-bslas/). This past summer, I worked at [Slalom Build](https://www.slalombuild.com/) in Chicago as a data engineering intern, where I created data pipelines, trained machine learning models, and transformed data into something meaningful. I've been working with AWS for about a year now and recently earned my [certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/a14cfdef-2119-4f1a-a863-63519d54dc28/public_url) as a Certified Developer Associate! I've also had experience working with Airflow and Kafka, different SQL/NoSQL databases, as well as data warehousing (Snowflake/Amazon Redshift). 

**In my free time**, I...
- contribute to my engineering sorority [Alpha Omega Epsilon](http://aoetheta.org/)
- spend a lot of time active! I am usually on my feet running 30 miles a week, but I've taken a new interest in weightlifting üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- [read](https://www.goodreads.com/belzki) books on any interest of mine! mostly non-fiction but I enjoy the occasional YA romance
- learn [languages](https://duome.eu/chaleurhumaine) (the human kind here, not programming) -- a [pipe dream](https://abelkartwii.github.io/abelkartwii/languages) languages of mine is to learn one language from each major language family
- go on coffee study breaks with my besties ‚òïÔ∏è

**In the future**, I would like to...
- dive deeper into backend/cloud infrastructure, site reliability engineering, and cloud computing
- learn how Kubernetes works
- read more books on data engineering (and maybe publish my own book?)
- go backpacking across South America

### üçë fun facts
- my favorite song of all time is Carly Rae Jepsen's [Run Away With Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeccAtqd5K8)
- I can name all 195 countries in the world under 15 minutes (on an extremely good day...)
- I was allergic to seafood for 10 years
- I mix my coffee with chocolate protein powder... but if I had to spend money on coffee (which I do a lot unfortunately), I order a hazelnut latte with oat milk
