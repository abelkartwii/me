### üçã who I am
I explore data and the environment ‚Äî mostly separately, occassionally together.

There are so many things within (and outside of) those realms that I still haven't learned, and so my interests reflect a broad scope of topics. Right now they converge around **data engineering**, cloud computing, distributed systems, **climate change**, **tech ethics**, feminism, and possibly many others I have yet to explore. I've thought a lot about pipelines and how data can be reprocessed, how data can illustrate complex truths in our world, as well as the power of tech and how we can leverage it for the environment!

### üçé what I do
**Currently**, I am a rising junior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science and philosophy. This summer, I am working at Slalom Build in Chicago as a data engineering intern, where I create data pipelines, train machine learning models, and transform data into something meaningful. I've been working with AWS for about a year now, and am currently pursuing a certification! I've also had experience working with Airflow and Kafka, different SQL/NoSQL databases (currently with Snowflake), as well as the cloud (AWS).

**In my free time**, I...
- contribute to my engineering sorority [Alpha Omega Epsilon](http://aoetheta.org/), where I have met some of the most wonderful women in STEM
- spend a lot of time at the gym! I was usually on my feet running 30 miles a week, but I've taken a new interest in weightlifting üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- [read](https://www.goodreads.com/belzki) books on any interest of mine! 
- learn [languages](https://duome.eu/chaleurhumaine) (the human kind here, not programming) -- a [pipe dream](https://abelkartwii.github.io/abelkartwii/languages) languages of mine is to learn one language from each major language family
- take coffee study breaks with my besties ‚òïÔ∏è

- I can name all 195 countries in the world under 15 minutes
