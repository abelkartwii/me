### üçã who I am
I explore data and the environment ‚Äî mostly separately, occassionally together.

There are so many things within (and outside of) those realms that I still haven't learned, and so my interests reflect a broad scope of topics. Right now they converge around **data engineering**, cloud computing, distributed systems, microservices, **climate change**, **tech ethics**, feminism, and many others. I've thought a lot about pipelines and how data can be reprocessed and by people, how data can illustrate complex truths in our world, as well as the power of tech and how we can leverage it for the environment!

### üçé what I do
**Currently**, I am a rising junior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science and philosophy. This summer, I am working at Slalom Build in Chicago as a data engineering intern, where I create data pipelines, trained machine learning models, and transform data into something beautiful. I've been working with AWS for about a year now, and am currently pursuing a certification!

**In my free time**, I...
- contribute to my engineering sorority [Alpha Omega Epsilon](http://aoetheta.org/), where I have met some of the most wonderful women in STEM
- spend a lot of time at the gym! I was usually on my feet running 30 miles a week, but I've taken a new interest in weightlifting üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- [read](https://www.goodreads.com/belzki) books on any interest of mine! I love non-fiction and self-help
- learn [languages](https://duome.eu/chaleurhumaine) (the human kind here) -- a [pipe dream](https://abelkartwii.github.io/abelkartwii/languages) languages of mine is to learn one language from each major language family
